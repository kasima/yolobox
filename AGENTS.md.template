# Agent Onboarding

<!-- Describe your app/project here: what it does, primary interactions, architecture overview -->

## Container Environment

You're running inside a yolobox dev container. Your environment:

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `/workspace` | Your code (git worktree) |
| `/venv` | Python virtualenv (persistent) |
| `/npm` | npm global packages (persistent) |
| `/pipcache` | pip cache (persistent) |
| `/home/agent` | Home directory with auth |

**Useful commands:**
```bash
make agents              # List running containers
make agent-sh AGENT=name # Shell into container
```

**Installing packages (persists across restarts):**
```bash
pip install some-package    # Python
npm i -g some-tool          # Node.js
```

## Key Files

<!-- List the most important files an agent should read first -->

## Build and Test

<!-- Add your build/test commands here -->

## Repository Guidelines

### Coding Style
<!-- Describe your coding conventions -->

### Testing
<!-- Describe testing approach, how to run tests -->

### Commits
- Use imperative, concise commit messages: "Fix ...", "Add ...", "Update ..."
- Before committing code changes, let the user verify the changes first
- Tell the user how and what they need to verify

## Agent Tips

- Prefer running single tests for speed when iterating
- Ask the user to run interactive commands (simulators, GUIs) and paste output
- Don't commit tests without verifying they pass first
